1:  Jquery is generally easier to use then javascript.  Many of the things you
	do in javascript you can do in jquery in fewer lines of code.
2:	Our plugin follows best practices for javascript and jquery.  It is semantically 
	correct.  Our code is also resonably optimized.
3:	Something that could prevent our game from posting the scores to a different domain
	could be if there is a password of somesort on the domain we are attempting to 
	post to.
