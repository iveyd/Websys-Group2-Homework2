1: 	Jquery is generally easier to use then javascript.  Many of the things you
	do in javascript you can do in jquery in fewer lines of code. jquery by itself
	is lighter than java script.  This should mean that it loads faster than a similar
	script made using java script.
2:	Our plugin follows best practices for javascript and jquery.  It is semantically 
	correct.  Our code is also resonably optimized.  There are a few parts of it where
	the code is not very well optimized due to us adding it in at the last moment.
3:	Something that could prevent our game from posting the scores to a different domain
	could be if there is a password of somesort on the domain we are attempting to 
	post to.
